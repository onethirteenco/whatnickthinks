# WhatNickThinks.com (2008-2019)

WhatNickThinks.com was a website I used to run that published "reviews, rants, and more." First going online in 2008, WhatNickThinks began as a simple Google Sites page posting restaurant reviews in broken English. By the time is was all said and done, WhatNickThinks had evolved into publishing entertainment reviews. In 2019, WhatNickThinks.com was formally shut down for the final time. In 2022, the domain, WhatNickThinks.com, was let to expire. In 2024, One Thirteen reacquired the domain name and published the original "Hello, old friend." letter, in its original form.

## Timeline

WhatNickThinks would have never started if not for a fateful trip to Buckley's Tavern, circa 2008.
- 2008: Received subpar buffalo wings and was urged to post my thoughts online. Shortly after, WhatNickThinks was published to Google Sites.
- 2010: The first subdomain, WhatNickThinks.YolaSite.com, was purchased, ushering in a new era of design and website features.
- 2012: The full domain, WhatNickThinks.com, was purchased, restaurant reviews stopped, and entertainment reviews began.
- 2015: WhatNickThinks transitioned from Yola for hosting/design to Squarespace.
- 2019: WhatNickThinks.com was formally shut down for the final time.
- 2022: The domain name, WhatNickThinks.com, was let to expire after 14 years of ownership.

## Featured Categories

The site's tagline/slogan read, "Reviews, Rants, and More!". Some common articles included:
- Film & Television reviews, rated out of five stars. Television reviews often included both episodes and full season reviews.
- Rants and gut reactions to the most recent episodes of television, the most popular of which being Graceland season three ("Dog Catches Car").
- Technology-oriented articles covering desk setups, cool products, and, eventually, technology reviews.
